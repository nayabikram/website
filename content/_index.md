<div class="project-description">
<p>Part of the the body of work “In Between”, consists of potraits of a Salvadora Oleoides tree and a Pinetree, where I see parts of myself reflecting in the trees.The picture of the Salvadora Oleoides tree, was taken in Badshahi Mosque, in Lahore, Pakistan. While the photo of the Pinetree was taken in the countryside in Ostrobothnia, a region of Finland.

The trees symbolise origins and roots, and also remind us that humans should not be defined on the basis of origin but rather on context. But the trees also symbolise the sense of home and the fact that you can feel at home in more than one place.</p>
